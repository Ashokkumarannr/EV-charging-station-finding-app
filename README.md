EV Charging Station Finder App
This repository contains the design files and documentation for an EV Charging Station Finder App, created using Figma. The app aims to help electric vehicle (EV) users easily find and navigate to the nearest charging stations.

Overview
As the adoption of electric vehicles continues to grow, one of the main concerns for EV owners is finding accessible and reliable charging stations. Our app addresses this need by providing a user-friendly interface that helps users locate charging stations, view their availability, and navigate to them efficiently.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a clean and intuitive interface to ensure ease of use.
Real-Time Data: Displays real-time information on the availability of charging stations.
Navigation Integration: Offers seamless integration with navigation apps for easy directions.
Filtering Options: Users can filter stations by charging speed, type of connector, and other criteria.
Favorites: Allows users to save their preferred charging stations for quick access.
User Reviews: Users can read and write reviews about the charging stations.
Design Process
Our design process involved several stages to ensure a comprehensive and user-centric approach:

Research and Analysis:

Conducted market research to understand the needs and pain points of EV users.
Created user personas to guide the design process (e.g., Alex Green, a 35-year-old software engineer from San Francisco, CA).
Wireframing:

Developed wireframes to outline the basic structure and layout of the app.
Ensured that the app's flow was logical and intuitive.
